## 🧠 Creator Notes

Thanks for checking out my music app!  
This is my first full-stack application, built during a 13-week coding bootcamp with Code Platoon.  
Development took approximately 3 weeks.

I chose to build a music app because I love listening to and sharing music with friends and family — especially those tracks that just *hit*.

## 🛠️ Biggest Challenges

1. **Spotify Web Playback SDK**  
   This took about 3 days to get working properly. I leaned on YouTube tutorials, Spotify's documentation, and help from my instructors.

2. **Application Architecture**  
   I often found that functions or variables created in one component were needed elsewhere, which led to a lot of "lifting state up" and refactoring shared logic.

## 🚀 Future Plans

- Add a song queue system
- Pages for artists, albums, and genres
- Follow other users to see what they’re listening to
- Like/favorite artists, albums, and genres
- Add local shows to user profiles
