## Creator Notes
Thanks for checking out my music app! This is my first ever full-stack application that I developed while in my 13-week coding bootcamp with Code Platoon.
I chose to make a music app because I love listening to music, sharing it with friends/family, and especially when you find a song that scratches just the right part of your brain.

## Biggest Issues
I ran into 2 main issues while developing:
- Working with Spotify's Playback API
  - This took me the better part of 3 days to get working properly. I used a few Youtube videos, the Spotify documentation, and my class instructors to figure this out.
- The second issue was the overall architecture of building it. I found multiple times that when I was creating a new function, variable, etc inside of a component or page, I'd
often need that function, variable, etc somewhere else in my project. So multiple times I ended up having to "elevate" that to a higher echelon in my stack.

## Future Plans
- I plan to have a few more capabilities in the app :
  - Create a queue of songs to play
  - Add pages for artists, albums, and genres to explore 
  - Add functionality to follow other users, so you can see what they're listening to and what things you have in common (songs, artists followed, etc)
  - Add artists, albums, and genres to "like" 
  - Be able to add local shows that you will be attending to your profile
