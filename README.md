## üß† Creator Notes
As of May 15, 2025:
This was my first full-stack application, and I'm proud of how far it‚Äôs come. That said, there‚Äôs definitely room for code cleanup and architectural improvements. Before adding new features, I plan to refactor and optimize the existing codebase as time allows. There‚Äôs a lot more I want to build into this app ‚Äî and I‚Äôm excited to keep improving it!

Thanks for checking out my music app!  
This is my first full-stack application, built during a 13-week coding bootcamp with Code Platoon.  
Development took approximately 3 weeks.

I chose to build a music app because I love listening to and sharing music with friends and family, especially those tracks that just *hit*.

## üõ†Ô∏è Biggest Challenges

1. **Spotify Web Playback SDK**  
   This took about 3 days to get working properly. I leaned on YouTube tutorials, Spotify's documentation, and help from my instructors.

2. **Application Architecture**  
   I often found that functions or variables created in one component were needed elsewhere, which led to a lot of "lifting state up" and refactoring shared logic.

- Pages for artists, albums, and genres
- Follow other users to see what they‚Äôre listening to
- Like/favorite artists, albums, and genres
- Add local shows to user profiles
