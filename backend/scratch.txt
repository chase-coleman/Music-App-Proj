!! Issues that I ran into !!
- Managing hidden variables inside of the project.
    I actually did quite a few commits with my .env file visible. So I had to go into the CLI and do a bunch
    of 'rm' commands for the .env file.

- Deleting all user's playlists when the 'delete' button was clicked
    in my playlist Page I created a state of 'delBtn'
    
    In my playlists page/component, I had a page to display all a logged user's created playlists.
    there was a delete button that attached to each playlist, and when the user clicked it, it kept
    deleting all of their playlists, not just the one that was clicked.

    this issue was caused because I created the 'delBtn' state inside of the playlist page,
    and when I was mapping through the usersPlaylists and I passed down the 'delBtn' as a prop.
    but by doing that, all playlists were attached to the same delBtn state. So when I deleted one,
    it deleted all of them. To fix this, 
    I created the delBtn state inside of the Playlist component so that each playlist belonged to it's own 
    delBtn state.
